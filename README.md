Project's learning objectives:
1. Quantifying scRNAseq data
2. Learning how to use and troubleshoot nf-core pipelines (parameters, versions)
3. Parsing and wrangling data formats
4. Analysis structure:
   - nf-core
   - seurat
5. Reporting (md documents, Renv package)
6. QC (filtering, doublets)
7. Cell annotation (manual/automated), stratification by a feature expression (in this case-Brk)
8. Diff expression analysis (dataset integration within cell types/time points, statistical analysis)
